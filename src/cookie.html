								Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies when you use https://Tech2ads.com.
							</p>
							<p>
								This Cookie Policy is issued by Tech2Ads LTD.  and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (referred to as  “we”, “us”, “our” or “Tech2Ads” in this Cookies Policy).
							</p>

								This policy applies to our use of “cookies” or similar technologies (like scripts, tracking pixels, web beacons) in connection with Tech2Ads website – https://tech2ads.com/(“Website”) and services.
							</p>

								<b>What are cookies?</b>
							</h2>
							<p>
								Cookies are small text files that are placed into the user's device when you visit a website, downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a site and allow a site to recognize your device. Cookies store information about the user’s visit, which may include content viewed, language preference, time and duration of each visit and advertisement accessed. Cookies managed by Tech2Ads only are called “first party cookies” whereas cookies from third parties are called “third party cookies”.
							</p>
							<h2>
								<b>What types of cookies exist?</b>
							</h2>
							<p>
								<b>First-party and third-party cookies</b>
							</p>
							<p>First-party cookies collect information about how you use our platform. They help to determine, for example, which sections of the Site are of particular interest. In this way, we can alter the content of our Site to suit our users’ needs and improve their experience. Third-party cookies in turn are set by third parties, such as social networks. They are primarily used to integrate social media content, such as plug-ins, on our Site.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Session and persistent cookies</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								The key difference between session and persistent cookies is that the data from the former ones is stored only for the duration of the current session. When the user closes the browser, the data becomes unavailable. They facilitate navigation and make visiting the Site more convenient. Persistent cookies may be stored indefinitely and are primarily used to identify your device when you re-enter our Site or App.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Our Website cookies</b>

							<p>
								When you visit the Tech2Ads website, we utilize cookies to automatically gather specific information about your visit and interactions on our Website.

Additionally, we can acquire aggregated geographic and demographic data about our visitors and users.
