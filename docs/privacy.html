							This document (referred to as the “Policy”) elucidates our approach to privacy concerning the processing of Personal Information within Tech2Ads’s advertising solutions and platforms, as well as on Tech2Ads’s official website (referred to as the “Site”). Your Personal Information is handled in accordance with the terms outlined in this Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							This Policy pertains to the information we might handle:

						<ul>
							<li>
								Regarding visitors who access, utilize, or engage with the Site, as well as individuals who communicate with us for inquiries;
							</li>

						<h2>1. THE SERVICES</h2>
						<p>
							Tech2Ads furnishes Customers with tailor-made digital and programmatic advertising solutions, bolstered by exclusive platforms and optimization technologies. Consequently, Tech2Ads maintains no direct interaction with individuals who frequent Customers’ websites and/or applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Personal Information amassed by Tech2Ads is primarily employed in the context of Real-Time Bidding — a sophisticated technological framework allowing advertising purchasers to bid “in the moment” for the chance to display online advertisements whenever an End User accesses a web page, app, or any other digital media source.
						</p>
						<p>
							We gather data that you furnish to our Customers, in addition to information regarding your device, as elaborated upon in the Policy.

						</p>
						<h2>2.1. Visitors to Our Site and Individuals Contacting Us with Inquiries</h2>
						<p>We, or designated third parties acting on our behalf, gather and employ personal information that may encompass:</p>
						<ul>

						<p>
							The Site also incorporates links to third-party social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, LinkedIn®, accompanied by associated social media features and scripts, like the Facebook® “like” button and widgets. These elements and scripts are designed to collect your IP address, determine the page you are visiting on the Site, and establish a cookie to facilitate their proper functionality. Social media features and widgets are hosted either by the relevant third-party social media platforms or directly on the Site.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your interactions with these social media features, widgets, and the social media platforms themselves are subject to the privacy policies of the respective social media sites. If you provide Personal Information in a comment on a blog post or on any related social media platform, it’s important to recognize that this information may be read, gathered, or used by others, potentially leading to unsolicited messages or unauthorized contact without your consent or intent.
						</p>
						<p>
							It’s important to note that the submission of Personal Information in these forums is your responsibility, and we are not accountable for the Personal Information you choose to disclose.
						</p>
						<p>
							During your interactions with us, whether initiated by you or by us, any Personal Information you provide will be received and processed.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to other endorsements, we showcase personal testimonials from contented Customers on the Site. With your consent, we may publish your testimonial accompanied by your name. Should you wish to modify or remove your testimonial, please reach out to us at: support@Tech2Ads.com.

						<h2>
							2.3. End Users
						</h2>
						<p>
							We, or designated third parties acting on our behalf, gather and utilize personal information which may include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Personal Information provided by the End User to our Customers, encompassing attributes like age or gender;
							</li>
							<li>
								Details concerning the End User’s device, comprising device specifications, model, manufacturer, operating system version, connection type, and device identifiers such as mobile advertising IDs (such as Apple’s iOS Identifier for Advertising or Google’s Android Advertising ID).

							</li>
							<li>
								Cookie: Cookies are modest text files retained in a web browser by websites or ad servers. They store information to facilitate preference retention or browser recognition between visits or across websites.
							</li>
							<li>
								Non-Cookie Technology: In a diverse online landscape with varied devices, software platforms, and services, cookies might not always be applicable. Consequently, alternative approaches, such as unique IDs provided by platforms like Apple’s iOS and Google’s Play Services for Android, are used for advertising distinction. Many mobile devices possess unique identifiers that can also serve as distinguishing marks. Furthermore, mathematical techniques can be employed to intelligently infer device recognition.
